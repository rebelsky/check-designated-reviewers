Dear NAME,

I note that you are listed as co-author on three or more submissions for SIGCSE TS 2025, none of which have designated a reviewer. We expect that anyone who is co-author on three or more submissions will offset the reviewing burden their submissions create by volunteering to review at least a few papers.

Please sign up to review for SIGCSE TS 2025 asap by visiting https://tinyurl.com/review-sigcse25 .

If you have questions, please write to program@sigcse2025.sigcse.org.

Thanks so much!

-- SamR, for Libby Shoop, Samuel A. Rebelsky, and James Prather, the TS 2025 Program Chairs
